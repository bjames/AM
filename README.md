Code for my AM halloween project (2025). 

I have edited nomouth.h to only include AM's speech at the end of the book to avoid legal issues. The actual piece display's the full text (in my basement, not in a public place). That said, the content of nomouth.h is taken directly from Harlan Ellison's "I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream"
